#Web Programming school - Fastcampus
Fastcampus is a one of the institutions that provide practical education for efficient adaptation of knowledge to work field. Among many courses, the 'web programming school' program is a high-intensive course that is teaching general programming knowledge to practical skills. As this is my first programming lecture that I have taken, this repository is to save and record what Iâ€™ve learned from this course. The language of this repo is going to be English since it is the widely written one in the GitHub. Even though my English is pretty awkward, please understand.
